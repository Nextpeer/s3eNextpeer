//
//  IMPORTRANT NOTE:
// 
//  This delegate should be implemented by games that have UNIFIED virtual currency with Nextpeer.
//  This means that the game is the one that stores the amount of currency a player and Nextpeer
//  manipulates this number using this delegate.
//

@protocol NPCurrencyDelegate <NSObject>
@required

// Nextpeer will call this function to retrieve the current amount of currency the player has
- (NSUInteger)nextpeerGetCurrency;

// Nextpeer will use this function to add a certain amount of currency to the total a player has. 
// This may be a result of currency consumption (negative amount, for example when entering a tournament) 
// or a currency gain (positive amount, when winning a tournament).
// 
// NOTE:    This method isn't necessarily called on the main thread! Take precaution when receiving this callback
//          and be sure to return quickly (i.e. do I/O in another thread) in order to have everything run smoothly.
- (void)nextpeerAddAmountToCurrency:(NSInteger)amount;

// Nextpeer will query this method to find out if the game supports the unified currecny model.
// Note that this will only be called once per Nextpeer initialization.
